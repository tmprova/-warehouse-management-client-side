              JavaScript is a client-side scripting language that is
              lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted. Both Java and HTML
              include it. Node.js, on the other hand, is a V8-based server-side
              programming language. JavaScript is a simple programming language
              that can be used with any browser that has the JavaScript Engine
              installed. Node.js, on the other hand, is an interpreter or
              execution environment for the JavaScript programming language. Any
              engine may run JavaScript. As a result, writing JavaScript is
              incredibly easy, and any working environment is similar to a
              complete browser. Node.js, on the other hand, only enables the V8
              engine.

              Nodejs is a Javascript engine that one can write any application
              he/she want with (by programming in the Javascript language).It
              runs on Javascript code.MongoDB is a database engine. Coded within
              some application or server uses MongoDB to save, query or update
              data in a database.The summary is MongoDB is a database where
              developers can store data and NodeJS helps them to connect their
              client site to database by it's server site.

              JWT, or JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security
              information between two parties â€” a client and a server. Each JWT
              contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims. JWTs are
              signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims
              cannot be altered after the token is issued. JWTs differ from
              other web tokens in that they contain a set of claims. Claims are
              used to transmit information between two parties. What these
              claims are depends on the use case at hand. For example, a claim
              may assert who issued the token, how long it is valid for, or what
              permissions the client has been granted.A JWT is a string made up
              of three parts, separated by dots (.), and serialized using
              base64. In the most common serialization format, compact
              serialization, the JWT looks something like this:
              xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz.
